# twm â€” Directional focus switcher for Windows

You've perfectly arranged your windows.
Code in the middle, terminal to your left, browser to your right.
You're **flying** through your task, deep in the zone.
But then it happens: you press `alt-tab` and it focuses the wrong window.
No matter, `alt-shift-tab`, `alt-tab-tab`.
Dammit, wrong window again.
Why is this so hard!?

No more!
With **twm**, you can move focus by pressing direction keys.
Duh!
`alt+right` to move focus to the right.
`alt+left` to go to the left.
Impossible to get wrong.
Vim shortcuts?
`alt+h/j/k/l` also work.

You can also swap adjacent windows with `alt+shift+<dir key>`.
